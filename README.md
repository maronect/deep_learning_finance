# Deep Sequential Models for Finance

This project explores sequential models applied to financial time series:

- [X] Portfolio optimization with Markowitz
- [X] Linear Regression
- [X] MLP
- [ ] RNN
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] BiLSTM
- [ ] GANs for synthetic scenarios

Organized for educational, research, and portfolio-building purposes.
